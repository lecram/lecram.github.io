# lecram.github.io

This repository includes both the sources and generated web pages for lecram.github.io.

Pages are written using the [NME markup](http://nyctergatis.com/creole/doc.html).
You need the [NME Markup Engine](http://nyctergatis.com/creole/index.html) to build the HTML pages.

Each page is generated by the script `gen.sh`, based on `template.html`.

A `Makefile` is provided so that we can automatically rebuild updated pages. Just type `make`.
