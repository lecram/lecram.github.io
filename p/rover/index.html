    <h1>Rover -- simple file browser for the terminal</h1>
    <p id="timestamp">Last updated on 2015-11-02 17:44:42 -0200</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lecram/rover">Rover</a> is a small file browser that aims to be
simple, fast and portable.</p>
<p>Feature overview:</p>

<ul>
  <li>multi-tab single panel directory listing</li>
  <li>navigation with vi-like key bindings</li>
  <li>file opening with <tt>$PAGER</tt> or <tt>$EDITOR</tt></li>
  <li>open <tt>$SHELL</tt> in the current directory</li>
  <li>create/rename/delete single files and directories</li>
  <li>copy/move/delete multiple files/directories</li>
</ul>
<p>Rover has a Terminal User Interface (TUI) designed to fit in a
small window. There are ten tabs, but only one is visible at each
time, selected by keys <tt>0</tt>-<tt>9</tt>. The number of the
current active/visible tab is shown at the top-right corner. The
starting path for each tab can be given as command-line arguments;
unassigned tabs will start at the current working directory. The
current directory of the active tab is shown at the top of the
screen.</p>

<p>The keys <tt>h</tt>, <tt>j</tt>, <tt>k</tt> &amp; <tt>l</tt> are
used to navigate in the file system. <tt>j</tt>/<tt>k</tt> moves the
cursor down/up, <tt>h</tt> goes to the parent directory and
<tt>l</tt> enters the selected directory. Additionally,
<tt>g</tt>/<tt>G</tt> goes to the first/last entry in the list.</p>
<p>To navigate faster whithin a directory, the keys <tt>J</tt>,
<tt>K</tt> &amp; <tt>/</tt> can be used. <tt>J</tt>/<tt>K</tt> moves
10 entries down/up. <tt>/</tt> starts an incremental search: entries
are selected as you type the desired filename prefix.</p>
<p>At the bottom-right corner, the number of entries on the current
directory is shown preceded by the number of the selected entry. This
information is also shown graphically as a vertical scroll bar on the
right side of the panel.</p>

<p>File browsers usually allow the user to open a file with an
appropriate program. Rover is still very limited on this area. There
are only two ways of opening a file: the key <tt>SPACE</tt> will
invoke <tt>$PAGER</tt> and the key <tt>e</tt> will invoke
<tt>$EDITOR</tt>. In both cases, Rover waits in the background until
you exit the invoked program.</p>
<p><img src="rv03.gif" alt="rv03.gif" /></p>
<p>Another handy feature is opening a shell in the current directory.
This can be done with the key <tt>ENTER</tt>. Rover sets the
environmental variable <tt>$RVSEL</tt> to the filename of the
selected entry.</p>

<p>Rover has some basic filesystem management commands. You can
create a file with <tt>n</tt> or a directory with <tt>N</tt>. The key
<tt>R</tt> lets you rename an entry. The key <tt>D</tt> lets you
delete an entry after confirmation.</p>
<p><img src="rv05.gif" alt="rv05.gif" /></p>
<p>In order to move a bunch files around, we first need to mark all
the entries with the key <tt>m</tt> and navigate to the destination
directory. Then we can press <tt>C</tt>/<tt>V</tt> to copy/move the
marked entries or <tt>X</tt> to delete all of them. Rover will show
the operation progress at the bottom.</p>
<p>When moving files between different locations, it's often
convenient to use a different tab for each location, so that we don't
need to navigate back and forth multiple times.</p>
