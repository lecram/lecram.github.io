    <h1>Rover -- simple file browser for the terminal</h1>
    <p id="timestamp">Last updated on </p>
<p>Rover is a small file browser that aims to be simple, fast and
portable.</p>
<p>Feature overview:</p>

<ul>
  <li>multi-tab single panel directory listing</li>
  <li>navigation with vi-like key bindings</li>
  <li>file opening with $PAGER or $EDITOR</li>
  <li>open $SHELL in the current directory</li>
  <li>create/rename/delete single files and directories</li>
  <li>copy/move/delete multiple files/directories</li>
</ul>
<p>Rover has a Terminal User Interface (TUI) designed to fit in a
small window. There are ten tabs, but only one is visible at each
time, selected by keys 0-9. The number of the current active/visible
tab is shown at the top-right corner. The starting path for each tab
can be given as command-line arguments; unassigned tabs will start at
the current working directory. The current directory of the active
tab is shown at the very top of the screen.</p>

<p>The keys h, j, k &amp; l are used to navigate in the file system.
j/k moves the cursor down/up, h goes to the parent directory and l
enters the selected directory. Additionally, g/G goes to the
first/last entry in the list. To navigate faster whithin a directory,
the keys J, K &amp; / can be used. J/K moves 10 entries down/up. /
starts an incremental search: entries are selected as you type the
desired filename prefix. At the bottom-left corner, the number of
entries on the current directory is shown preceded by the number of
the selected entry. This information is also shown graphically as a
vertical scroll bar on the right side of the panel.</p>
