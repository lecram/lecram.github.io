<h2 id="h4">1. About This Document</h2>
<p>This is a collection of useful idioms and tricks that can be used
while coding in C. These patterns were collected while writing and
reading real world code.</p>
<p>While this document has a focus on the practical use of the C
language, some effort was made to make it a little more didactical
than real world code. In particular, typedefs were used extensively
to isolate the definition of types not relevant to the concept being
explored. Please note that the excessive use of typedef in practice
may be harmful, making the code less readable and harder to interface
with tools and programs.</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity, the code presented here lacks proper
error checking.</p>
<h2 id="h697">2. Quickly Checking System Macro Value</h2>
<p>It's often convenient to know the expansion of a macro defined by
a system header. The naive way to do this is creating a small C
program with a main function that simply prints the value of the
macro. This requires that we create a new file, compile it and run
the executable.</p>
<p>The best way to print a macro expansion is by using the C
preprocessor (cpp). By default, cpp reads from stdin and writes to
stdout. This means we can type directives and macros and get the
resulting expansions immediatelly. cpp will usually print a lot of
uninteresting information, specially when processing #include
directives, so we may want to pipe it to tail.</p>
<p>As an example, let's check the value of &lt;stdio.h&gt;'s BUFSIZ:</p>
<pre>
$ cpp | tail -1
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
BUFSIZ
8192
</pre>
<p>Note that in this example we have typed &lt;CTRL+D&gt; after
typing &quot;BUFSIZ&quot;+&lt;RETURN&gt;.</p>
<h2 id="h1584">3. Dynamic Typing with Struct Tagging</h2>
<p>Useful to build simple object systems.</p>
<p>This exploits the fact that a struct can be casted to the type of
its first field (and vice versa):</p>
<pre>
typedef struct { int r, g, b; } Color;
Color c1 = {R, G, B};
int i = (int) c1;           /* i = R; */
Color c2 = (Color) i;       /* c2 = {R, ?, ?} */
</pre>
<p>Defining types:</p>
<pre>
typedef enum {INTEGER, REAL} Tag;
typedef Tag *Obj;
typedef struct {
    Tag tag;
    int val;
} Integer;
typedef struct {
    Tag tag;
    double val;
} Real;
</pre>
<p>Creating objects:</p>
<pre>
Integer *new_integer(int val) {
    Integer *i = malloc(sizeof(*i));
    i-&gt;tag = INTEGER;
    i-&gt;val = val;
    return i;
}
Real *new_real(double val) {
    Real *r = malloc(sizeof(*r));
    r-&gt;tag = REAL;
    r-&gt;val = val;
    return r;
}
</pre>
<p>Operator overloading via case (single C function):</p>
<pre>
void print_object(Obj obj) {
    Tag tag = *obj;
    switch (tag) {
        case INTEGER:
            printf(&quot;%d&quot;, ((Integer *) obj)-&gt;val);
            break;
        case REAL:
            printf(&quot;%f&quot;, ((Real *) obj)-&gt;val);
            break;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Operator overloading via explicit dispatch table (a.k.a. vtable):</p>
<pre>
void print_integer(Obj obj) {
    printf(&quot;%d&quot;, ((Integer *) obj)-&gt;val);
}
void print_real(Obj obj) {
    printf(&quot;%f&quot;, ((Real *) obj)-&gt;val);
}
typedef void (*Func) (Obj obj);
static Func print[] = {print_integer, print_real};
void print_object(Obj obj) {
    Tag tag = *obj;
    print[tag](obj);
}
</pre>
<p>An object can carry more information than just a type tag. For
example, to allow reference counting:</p>
<pre>
typedef enum {INTEGER, REAL} Tag;
typedef struct {Tag tag; unsigned refc;} Header;
typedef Header *Obj;
typedef struct {
    Header header;
    int val;
} Integer;
typedef struct {
    Header header;
    double val;
} Real;
</pre>
<p>Note that we can also do casts between two different structs that
share the same prefix:</p>
<pre>
typedef struct { Color c; Point ul, br; } Rect;
typedef struct { Color c; Point o; double r; } Circle;
Rect rect = {RED, P1, P2};
Circle circle = (Circle) rect;      /* a red circle centered at P1 */
</pre>
<h2 id="h3700">4. Dynamic Contiguous Homogeneous Array</h2>
<p>A contiguous array is the most simple and efficient collection
structure for homogeneous data. C has great builtin support for fixed
sized arrays. Sometimes it's convenient to have an array that grows
(and shrinks) as necessary. The function realloc() makes this very
simple. The basic idea is to multiply the array size by a constant
every time it needs more space.</p>
<p>The exact value of the constant doesn't affect assymtoptic
complexity. In practice, many programs use 2, growing the array by
doubling its size. However, this choice must take into consideration
the behavior of reallocators. In some environments/languages,
reallocations cannot be done in-place (i.e. without changing
address). This limitation causes a &quot;walking pointer&quot; when
doubling a buffer's size. Using a Fibonacci sequence for size will
circunvent this problem, assuming the reallocator is able to move
overlapping data (as in memmove()). If copying overlapping buffers is
not possible (as in memcpy()), then the Padovan sequence must be
used. In modern GNU/Linux environments, the realloc() function
doesn't seem to have any of these limitations, so the choice of
growing pattern is only determined by the time/memory trade-off:
smaller growth factors reduce memory waste, greater growth factors
reduce time waste.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's also nice to shrink the array to free unused
memory. The choice of whether to do this and how to do it is
dependent on the use pattern that the array is expected to have.</p>
<p>With these concepts in mind, we can implement a typical stack. It
shrinks when the amount of unused space reachs about the same size of
the used space.</p>
<pre>
typedef int Item; /* could be anything instead of int */
typedef struct {
    unsigned bulk;
    unsigned length;
    Item *items;
} Stack;

Stack *new_stack(unsigned init_bulk) {
    Stack *stack = malloc(sizeof(*stack));
    stack-&gt;bulk = init_bulk;
    stack-&gt;length = 0;
    stack-&gt;items = malloc(init_bulk * sizeof(*stack-&gt;items));
    return stack;
}
void push(Stack *stack, Item item) {
    if (stack-&gt;length == stack-&gt;bulk) {
        stack-&gt;bulk *= 2;
        stack-&gt;items = realloc(stack-&gt;items, stack-&gt;bulk * sizeof(*stack-&gt;items));
    }
    stack-&gt;items[stack-&gt;length++] = item;
}
Item pop(Stack *stack) {
    if (stack-&gt;length == stack-&gt;bulk / 2) {
        stack-&gt;bulk = stack-&gt;length;
        stack-&gt;items = realloc(stack-&gt;items, stack-&gt;bulk * sizeof(*stack-&gt;items));
    }
    return stack-&gt;items[--stack-&gt;length];
}
</pre>

<p>(cf. coral's Buffer)</p>
<h2 id="h6320">7. Stable Sort</h2>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6105590">http://stackoverflow.com/a/6105590</a></p>
<p>The standard qsort() function from &lt;stdlib.h&gt; is not stable,
but we can force stability by changing the comparison function to
account for item position.</p>
<p>Here's a description of the solution from StackOverflow:</p>
<div style="margin-left:2em">
  <p>The canonical solution is to make (i.e. allocate memory for and
  fill) an array of pointers to the elements of the original array,
  and qsort this new array, using an extra level of indirection and
  falling back to comparing pointer values when the things they point
  to are equal. This approach has the potential side benefit that you
  don't modify the original array at all - but if you want the
  original array to be sorted in the end, you'll have to permute it
  to match the order in the array of pointers after qsort returns.</p>
